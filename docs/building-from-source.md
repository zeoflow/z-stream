# Building From the Latest Source

If you'll be contributing to the library, or need a version newer than what has
been released, Password Strength from ZeoFlow can also be built from source.

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/zeoflow/password-strength.git
```

Then, build the library's AARs using Gradle
